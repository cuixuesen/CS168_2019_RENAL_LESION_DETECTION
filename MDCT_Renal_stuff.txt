Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignancy of the kidney, and accounts for 

approximately 2-3% of all cancers. Up to 70% of renal neoplasms are detected incidentally at 

imaging, and up to 40% of renal masses under one centimeter have been reported to be benign 

at nephrectomy. Historically, imaging has been used for lesion detection but not 

characterization, and all solid enhancing renal masses without macroscopic fat are presumed to 

be malignant. Up to 30% of lesions undergoing nephrectomy are found to be benign, most 

commonly oncocytoma and fat-poor angiomyolipoma (fp-AML), subjecting these patients to 

risks of unnecessary anesthesia and surgery. While these benign lesions may undergo active 

surveillance, clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is more likely to be treated with resection or ablation due to 

its higher incidence and metastatic potential.   

Several studies have demonstrated unique multiphasic patterns of contrast enhancement for 

individual histological RCC subtypes on multiphasic multidetector computed tomography 

(MDCT). These patterns are identified by visual assessment of peak lesion enhancement and 

manual placement of a region of interest (ROI) within the most enhancing portion of the lesion 

and background cortex over multiple phases of enhancement, often without the use of a 

standardized four-phase protocol. This technique is inherently operator dependent and 

subjective, with variable results reported.  A reproducible and robust method to differentiate 

renal lesions on imaging is desired to minimize subjectivity and ensure widespread 

Applicability.
